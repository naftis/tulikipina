            li We don`t use any motorized activities or equipment, because our core value is keeping the environment’s natural peace and tranquility.
            li We offer both ready-to-go packages and tailor made trips. We also rent out our kayaks, canoes and other trekking equipment.
            li In the summertime all adventures are also available during nighttime under the Midnight Sun.
            li In winter, when Polar Darkness is surrounding us, nothing is more magical than the snowy forest under the bright moonlight reflecting off of the white snow!
